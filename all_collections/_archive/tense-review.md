# Tense Consistency Review: Citation Attention 3T Team Article

Based on the WRITING-GUIDE.md guidance: **Present simple should be the default tense** for professional writing, used for current facts, general principles, and analytical statements. Past simple should be used only for completed actions with specific timeframes. Present perfect connects past actions to present relevance.

| # | Line | Original Sentence | Issue | Proposed Modification |
|---|------|------------------|-------|----------------------|
| 1 | 16 | "Historical precedent shows specialized team structures deliver 40-60% performance advantages during technological transitions" | "shows" + "deliver" is correct present simple, but "during" suggests ongoing action - should clarify this is a general principle from past evidence | "Historical precedent shows that specialized team structures delivered 40-60% performance advantages during technological transitions" (past simple for completed historical events) |
| 2 | 17 | "Democratization must precede specialization—baseline AI capabilities across all teams foment the culture and base that enable specialists to focus on frontier work extending competitive moats" | "foment" and "enable" are present simple for general principle, but reads awkwardly - unclear if describing current state or future recommendation | "Democratization must precede specialization—when baseline AI capabilities develop across all teams, they create the cultural foundation and knowledge base that enable specialists to focus on frontier work extending competitive moats" |
| 3 | 26 | "It mirrors historical technological transitions—but, perhaps, compressed into a shorter adaptation cycle." | "mirrors" (present) describes current situation correctly, but "compressed" (past participle) creates tense ambiguity | "It mirrors historical technological transitions—but with compression into a shorter adaptation cycle."

## Summary

The article generally maintains good tense consistency, with most issues falling into these patterns:

1. **Past participles and present participles mixed with main verbs**: Creating ambiguity about whether actions are completed, ongoing, or general principles
2. **Present continuous used where present simple is more appropriate**: For general statements about current practices
3. **Modal verbs creating unnecessary complexity**: When present simple would be clearer
4. **Historical examples correctly using past simple**: These are generally well-handled

The WRITING-GUIDE emphasizes that **present simple should be the default** for:
- Current business conditions and market realities
- General principles and established theories
- Analysis and comparisons
- Describing what the document accomplishes

The proposed modifications maintain this default while using past simple only for clearly completed historical events and present perfect for past actions with continuing relevance.
