<Greeting>

What if I told you the way we all use the Internet is changing.
[Slide-1]
Imagine this with me.

It’s Tuesday. You wake to a gentle buzz and a notification: “Coffee meeting at 8:15.” You say, “Play some morning music,” and a playlist you never created matches your mood perfectly. 

As you take your morning shower, you ask, “What’s the weather like today? Do I need an umbrella?”. A screen in your mirror lights up. It will be 21 degrees and windy today. A disembodied voice repeats it to you and adds, "I suggest you bring a jacket". 

In the kitchen, as you're drinking your morning coffee you notice your fridge has already queued up a grocery list for bananas and oat milk. Woolworths earliest delivery is for Thursday afternoon.

You jump into your EV to go to your Coffee Meeting at the Noosa Coffee Roastery. The route comes up on the screen. Traffic will be moderate, you should be there by 8.12am. You engage self-driving mode because you're lazy.

On the drive you remember that you're having friends fly up from Sydney this weekend and you've forgotten to organize dinner with them... Because you're lazy. You ask your EV, "what's the best seafood restaurant nearby for dinner?". It flashes up with a listing for Sails, and you reply, "good enough, book me a table for 4 at 7PM on Sunday". OpenTable pops up and says, "Sorry, that time isn't available, the nearest open reservation time is at 7.15pm", you say, "that'll do", and it books the table as you roll up in front of the roastery.

After the coffee meeting you head to your office, on the way you see 3 unread emails. You say, "summarise these 3 emails and prepare responses for each". As you walk from the car to your desk in the office, you pick up the 3 newly created drafts in your phone's mail app. You review them. They seem reasonable, and you click send.

Now, does anyone notice what didn’t happen?
<That's right... / No? Well...>
In this entire thought experiment, you didn’t open a browser. You didn’t type a query. You didn’t click through to a website or scroll a page. But, the internet was there—powerfully, intimately—but also invisibly. 

Show of hands: who thinks this scenario will be commonplace within two years? Keep them up. 

Who thinks five years? 

And who thinks ten?
[Slide-2]
Everyone, this is the adoption curve in practice. While some of us expect this to happen sooner, and some of us, later, all of us, myself included, see this as a plausible reality. What this means is that we have crossed the "adoption chasm" - that moment when a technology, like AI, is no longer considered novel. 

First we see edge use cases, like with facial recognition in the airport, then as conveniences, like when ChatGPT was suddenly being used by everyone's mum to help her figure out the computer instead of calling you, and finally as expectations, like how we all expect to have AI voice assistants on our phone understand what we mean when we say "play the latest episode" of your favorite podcast.

What we are living through right now is, what I call "sense-making compression". 

Where previously, technology like the smartphone, the computer, or even going back to the telegraph was a form of distance compression, i.e. communication was measured in how few meters you are away from a phone, or how many minutes it took you to find the right recipe page on Serious Eats; we now measure compression in how few cognitive steps there are between an intention and an outcome you’re trying to achieve. 
[Slide-3]
For most of our lives, we have studied furiously to adapt to machines-we had to learn their commands, their file trees, their frameworks, their bugs-in order to use them.

A year ago, how you might try to make sense of something might have gone like this: you have a question; you translate it into the right keywords; then you scan ten blue links; open three tabs; skim; copy-paste; compare; draft; revise; and then finally make a decision; and that is assuming that you know how to use a computer and a browser already, which, let's face it, we all know a few people who aren't great at it. 

Today, more and more often, that path looks like this: you say or prompt the thing you want, in your own words, an answer appears word by word, and then decide whether to accept, refine, or reject it. In some places, like with Perplexity's newly released Comet browser, the action can be taken for you.
[Slide-4]
To make this concrete, think about how children interact. If a six-year-old wants a bedtime story about a blue dragon who loves mangoes and lives under the Starry Bridge, he or she doesn’t start by finding a search interface and then understanding it's query syntax. No, you and I know, they're going to just ask for it in their own way and they'll just expect a response that fits their expectation—he or she is not going to adapt her question to match the interface, whether that inferface is her parents or not. And that is going to be the expectation for kids born in 2025 onwards. They will be the first generation to grow up expecting machines to adapt to them. 

So, what does that mean for all of us dinosaurs?

There is the dramatic change in human behaviour that, as digital professionals, we all need to now come to terms with. This is where understanding sense-making compression comes into play. 

Search presumes that you, the human, orchestrate the steps: you phrase, you scan, you click, you synthesise, you *decide*. AI Assistants now absorb this work of orchestration. *It* is the one that fetches, weighs, composes, and sometimes even acts—then hands you a shaped output: "here you go, I've booked your appointment".

That absorption has economic effects, though. When an answer arrives in a chat box or through a voice, a human may never visit a website. That means a page view doesn’t happen. An ad doesn’t render. The affiliate link doesn’t fire. This is that familiar funnel built on the assumption that awareness becomes curiosity and then becomes a click. In many contexts, the click is just not there. Hence, the rise of what we now call zero-click. The most recent studies have shown that 60% of all Google searches now result in no clicks and this is set to rise even faster now that Google is now making AI overviews default.

This is bad news if you rely on click-derived revenue like ad impressions, or, like us, fast websites—just as the telegraph was disruptive for business models built on users who relied on boats that might have been slow, horses that might have been tired or long delays caused by transportation paperwork. 

If the telegraph's effects on the nineteenth century taught us anything, though, it’s that compression produces second-order effects we often miss at first. The telegraph's distance compression reorganised markets, geopolitics, and even the weather report. Meaning compression is beginning to reorganise the white-collar day. Now, the most precious artefact of many modern jobs isn’t being able to source, synthesize or create a knowledge product like an article, or blog post or report for your boss. If assistants are reducing the cost of this, the advantage shifts to those who can push past this and can make precise, well-reasoned, context-aware decisions at speed.

It's why the education sector is struggling and entry level roles are facing unprecedented obsolescence. We all have access to deeply researched expertise, at our fingertips, for very little time, effort or cost. Knowing and doing are declining in importance, while strategic decision making is increasing.
[Slide-5]
And that brings us to the WordPress community—we have been the builders of the open web. Our work has been the raw material that these AI systems draw from: posts, pages, products, courses and even event calendars. If our world is rushing toward sense-making compression, then the places where meaning that informs that sense-making is published and structured become even more important. WordPress is one of those places, and, at over 43% of the web, a big one at that. The faster AI technologies are being adopted, the more the world depends on what WordPress creators publish.

This is the pivot I want us to sit with tonight: we have lived through an era in which the web and WordPress's superpower was distance compression for content—publishing from anywhere to everywhere. We are entering an era in which the web’s superpower is sense-making compression for tasks—moving from intention to completion with the human only there for oversight if at all i.e. "human in the loop"

With that frame, let’s talk about what’s changing, and what it means for anyone who builds on the open web and with WordPress sites.
[Slide-6]
For three decades, we’ve lived with a simple mental model: the web is documents, linked together, displayed by a browser. You go to Google, you type, you scan, you click. The click is the bridge between your question and content to answer it. 

In the agentic web, that bridge is often not traversed by you. Instead of serving documents to humans, we are increasingly serving meaning to machines, and machines are creating and then serving outputs to people.

In practice, this would be an agent making a flurry of calls to structured endpoints to: fetch this statistic, confirm this date, compare these prices, summarise these reviews before comparing these with this user’s prompt, and then delivering a single response—sometimes with an action to: order it, book it, draft it, or schedule it.

This is wonderfully convenient for users. But it has profound consequences. Instead of hundreds of humans arriving in your analytics, you may see far more automated requests over an API—or no visible requests at all because an agent has read your page once, understood it, and now consults a distilled representation of that knowledge from it's own database. You might be cited in an assistant’s response, or you might be one of many sources blended into a synthesis. Either way, the familiar metrics wed relied upon in Google Analytics—page views, sessions, bounce rate—stop telling the whole story.

This can be unsettling. We’ve invested years of our time mastering discoverability in a world of pages and clicks, or at least thousands of our dollars outsourcing that mastery. But this isn't the end of human engagement with the Internet. That engagement is simply now flowing through new intermediaries. And our task now is to make WordPress legible to those intermediaries so they can understand it, trust it, and carry it forward with attribution when a human does request it.

What does that mean in practice for WordPress sites?
[Slide-7]
It starts with a shift in posture. We need to write for two audiences at once. The first audience is a machine trying to answer a question. The second is a human who, when they do arrive, deserves narrative and personalization.

Writing for that first audience isn't about stuffing keywords; it's about semantic optimization. That means structuring your content so AI can understand and cite it. 

Start with a summary. Open with 40 to 60 words that get to the point, because AI tools favor early content and quotable content. 

Define your terms clearly using direct definitions like "X is..." to anchor the topic. 
[Slide-8]
Also, when someone wants to know, for example, "How do I publish a post?" they aren't looking for a memoir. They want clear, skimmable content—bullet lists, tables, FAQs, and how-to steps. These formats are easy and, more importantly, also quotable, for AI. 

I also recommend as a writing style to read into the work of William Zinsser.
[Slide-9]
Next, trust signals are no longer nice-to-haves. 

Agents actually rely on them as proof of credibility and they directly contribute to getting cited in outputs. So, you want to make sure that you or your author's credentials are made visible. 

This can include author bios, publication dates, and expert quotes, linking to authoritative sources like government sites, academic journals, or WordPress.org or the WordPress Codex. 

If you've done original research yourself, make it obvious, provide a ready to consume reference and structure it in a way that is easy to parse.
[Slide-10]
To structure your content strongly, you will also need to master standard schema.org markup to tag your content properly—e.g. labeling it as an Article, Review, Product, Event, or VideoObject—so an AI agent knows what it's looking at. 

There are plenty of plugins that allow you to adhere to schema.org standards, such as the plugin "Schema & Structured Data for WP & AMP" (that is it's literal name), if you don't know how to do so already. 

But there's also actually a bit of a hack you can use. What you'll want to do is chuck your content into one of these AI chat interfaces using this prompt and it will give you a ready to use HTML snippet you can paste into the page or post:

Then there's the technical foundation. AI tools can't use content they can't access. 
[Slide-11]
From an infrastructural perspective that means planning capacity to take into account machine or autonomous traffic. 

On our own platform, over 70% of the hits across our fleet are now autonomous, and this tracks with similar figures coming from research published by DigitalOcean and Siteground. 

Across the wider Internet, 2025 was the first year where more than 50% of the global Internet traffic was autonomous and it's changing at a rate of ~2% per year in favour of bots. 

So, to make sure you're getting the right traffic at the WordPress application level, you'll also want to make sure bots such as BingBot, GPTBot, and PerplexityBot are allowed in your robots.txt and server settings. A plugin like Dark Visitors is a great plugin to monitor bot traffic and manage which bots can access and not access your site.

And because bots are basically blind and generally have access to minimal processing power, your site should load fast, work on well on mobile, which is a good proxy for how good your site is for low powered browsing anyway, and it should keep content visible without relying on JavaScript that bots can't render. 

For those of you who have heard of LLMs.txt, which is an emerging standard that is supposed to help LLMs read web content, there is still contestation over it's acceptance. 

For now, no major AI platform has yet officially adopted it, but we can see in our own fleet logs that their bots *do* hit LLMs.txt files. 

We don't know how much prominence the content in these files is given versus the rest of your content, but there have been studies published showing strongly structured data is more likely to be cited for a given prompt versus less strongly structured data. 

If you want to learn more about the proposed standard I recommend you visit llmstxt.org.
[Slide-12]
Finally, consider building interactive tools—calculators, checkers, selectors—that solve real problems that your content speaks to-you don't want to provide an interest calculator if you're a recipe website, but you might want to implement a recipe suggestion tool given an ingredient. Embed this directly into your content. We know that users now very rarely click through AI overviews or outputs, so tools like this that can't be replicated by the AI interface can drive traffic to your page that AI outputs can't supplant because it's useful and provides value to your user.
[Slide-13]
Now, unlike the all encompassing global rules of Google Search, each AI platform also has its own rules about what is important to show. For example, based on the the research and practice I've done, if we take the subject of "Best SEO plugin for WordPress"...

For ChatGPT, it's basically Bing. That means you want to have, again, structured content with clear headings, but also you want to be explicitly answering "best X for Y" questions. 

For Perplexity, you have to think of their PerplexityBot like an academic researcher. That means you'll want to diversify your sources, use authoritative sources, and focus on factual detail such as statistics and studies.

For Google's Gemini, start with strong introductions, but, also, like traditional SEO, you need to use E-E-A-T-Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. For example, you could be citing the length of your experience, providing testimonials, quotes, endorsements, and credentials, and implementing deep schema markup like I mentioned previously.
[Slide-14]
Beyond your own content, it's even more important to build a presence across platforms. 

You'll want to join Reddit communities relevant to your content and expertise and answer niche questions, sharing insights. 

On YouTube, you want to produce clear, value-driven videos like how-tos, walkthroughs, discussions using accurate titles and descriptions. 

For Instagram, don’t just post pretty images: use carousels, behind-the-scenes stories, and expert reels that introduce faces, skills, and context behind the scenes. 

On TikTok, create quick tips, personal stories, and reactions that make your expertise feel authentic.

Adapt to match platform’s strengths. For each platform reference your credentials in your bio and link it back to your site. Each post you make, mention you earn, or expert answer you give increases your visibility for *both* people and AI tools. 

Modern AI—search engines, chatbots, virtual assistants—draw answers and authority from the entire web. By broadening your reach, you’re not only seen by more people, but also by more bots.
[Slide-15]
Lastly, how do we measure success in an age where answers matter and clicks and impressions do not? 

Well, you want to start tracking AI citations. 

Are ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini mentioning your brand or quoting your expertise when users ask direct or related questions? 

Tools like SEMRush can monitor how often your content shows up in AI Overviews by filtering for AI Overview in the Positions tab, and Google Search Console’s can show now you when your pages get surfaced by Google’s AI snapshots or generated AI overviews using AI mode.

But Google has been losing search marketshare since late 2024 now, from 92% to now below 89% this year. So, you also need to look for integration with Bing Copilot, Siri, and Alexa: build connectors, submit structured data, and test your brand’s answers regularly in these different modalities and interfaces. 

Finally, establish routine prompt-testing. 

Each month, systematically ask leading AI assistants common and niche questions in your industry, about your company, and your product niche. 

Log whether your brand comes up, how it is described, whether it's positive or negative sentiment, and which content they reference. You can consider it almost an on-demand 24/7 focus group.

So, these are the building blocks of visibility in an AI-first world.
[Slide-16]
To summarise, the goal isn't just to rank—it's to become the source AI platforms cite when they generate answers. Authority is the new truth. Be clear and structured in the information you provide. Be present everywhere AI looks. 

Beneath the tactics is a deeper mindset shift. We’re moving from publishing pages to publishing knowledge objects. From chasing page ranks to earning a place in a generated answer. We aren't acquiring traffic anymore. We need to prioritise acquiring trust.

Trust, in this era, is clarity. It’s provenance. It’s demonstrating stability. It’s the willingness to show your work: here is the claim; here is the evidence; here is who wrote it; here is when it was last updated. Machines can recognise the value of this just as well as we can.

If you run a WordPress site, you are not a bystander in this transition. You are the soil in which much of this new web is being grown. Your content will either be the raw material that agents select because it is clean, structured, and authoritative—or it will be bypassed by something that is.
[Slide-17]
So I’ll end where we began: with that ordinary Tuesday morning. The agents in that thought experiment-playing music, planning routes, drafting emails—weren’t magic. They were intermediaries. They understood intent, and they knew where to find trustworthy answers. Our job is to make sure those answers include us: our research, our expertise, our products, our stories. 

We should think of the first party audience now as being the AI assistant. And the second is the human it serves. If we build for both, while the click is becoming optional—our value isn’t.
[Slide-18]
Thank you.
