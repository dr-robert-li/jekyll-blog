## General Principles for Future Fact-Checking

### When Original Sources Cannot Be Verified:

1. **Search for Adjacent Research**: Look for studies on the same topic/industry even if not exact claim
2. **Use Related Metrics**: If 45% cannot be verified, find what CAN be verified (e.g., 40%, 50%)
3. **Attribute Specifically**: "Campaign X achieved Y" beats "Monks achieved Y across campaigns"
4. **Prefer Authoritative Sources**: McKinsey, Accenture, Gartner, etc. over blog posts
5. **Mechanism Over Number**: If percentage is unverifiable, explain WHY it works

### Citation Quality Hierarchy:

**Tier 1 (Strongest):**
- Peer-reviewed academic journals
- Official government/institutional reports
- Primary research from major consultancies (McKinsey, BCG, Accenture, Gartner)

**Tier 2 (Strong):**
- Industry association reports
- Reputable news outlets citing primary research
- Company case studies from verified sources (Microsoft, Google, etc.)

**Tier 3 (Acceptable):**
- Industry publications with documented methodology
- Expert analysis with cited sources
- Conference proceedings from major events

**Tier 4 (Avoid):**
- Blog posts without citations
- Generic "industry statistics" without source
- Marketing content without methodology
