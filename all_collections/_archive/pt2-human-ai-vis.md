Recap the prior assumptions in previous articles before next discussing implications and actionables:

1. We know that users click through citations at a much lower rate on AI platforms than in traditional search; that this differs depending on interface design e.g. Perplexity gets higher click through due to the greater prominence given to citations; whereas ChatGPT gets the lowest click through because it predictably makes citations the least prominent.
2. We know that this citation click through has increased dramatically since October 2024, according to Adobe research (2025), due to a combination of platform maturation (more robust citation functionality) and user's interface familiarity as adoption has increased. Adobe expects this trend to continue - it is unknown whether this will supplant/replace/compensate for traffic loss induced by this transition so far.
3. We know that each of the 4 major platforms (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and Perplexity) cite different sources at different rates, and that there is not much overlap between them-only 7% of sources measured as present as cited sources on all 4 platforms, but that they all cite a greater diversity of sources than traditional Google search which takes a winner takes all approach to presenting search results and user behavior in clicking through results, and that this is remarkably consistent across all traditional search queries. We know that this greater diversity is engineered as the underlying models these platforms rely on use the softmax algorithm in their terminating layer which inherently veers towards a winner takes all output, therefore, we can infer that these engineered "diversity valleys" are somewhat opinionated, whether for safety, and/or diversity. Gemini exhibits the lowest diversity of citation sources, ChatGPT exhibits the highest diversity, but the lowest 'k', so the narrowest diversity valley; whereas Perplexity and Claude exhibit the highest 'k', and therefore the widest diversity valley, but exhibit slightly less equal citation diversity. Whether this is owing to the re-ranking algorithm post-inference similarly veering towards citation concentration the larger the 'k' due to the greater frequency of overlapping results (this is the normal outcome over repeated similarity searches), or this is engineered, is unknown (Li, 2025).
4. We know that Practical Guidance-29%-and Writing-24%-are the most frequent use cases for users. We know that users will typically terminate their experiences in these domains within the AI platform's interface once they get sufficient detail. This creates the "authority-traffic paradox" where a brand can gain authority in a domain without seeing a causal increase in traffic-this is especially the case when dealing with non-critical information that a user is unlikely to validate. Therefore, one can infer that this "authority-traffic paradox" will be particularly problematic for websites that concentrate on content, which is typically seen as non-critical or typically has low criticality (Chatterji et al., 2025).
5. We know that only 24% of AI platform user actions exhibit the "seeking information" behavior which is most closely associated with traditional Google search behavior and that presents the greatest likelihood of citation click through. We know that, in this user journey, users exhibit a 2 stage AI decision architecture. Stage 1 is exploratory in nature, and user generated content is typically overrepresented in outputs during this stage of exploration. This exploration is facilitated by the natural language interface and followup query fan-out results and follows a synthetic socratic user flow, where users "Ask" of the content. We know that this is 49% of what users do on these AI platforms (as opposed to "Do", which still only preoccupies 40% of user activity), and we know that this stage of the AI decision architecture typically lives entirely within the AI platform's interface.
6. We know that it is only until stage 2 of the AI decision architecture, where a user is validating the information they have already ascertained, and it is only in this stage that user may click through to officially published information. This is the reason for the "mention-source divide" where community content, such as forums, discussions and reviews, is overrepresented; and officially published content which these AI models consider as authoritative of "source of truth" is less cited (officially published content is about half as effective in getting cited as user generated content). This "divide" signals that simply being talked about does not guarantee that an AI will cite or recommend a brand as trustworthy or authoritative. This also illustrates a need for a brand to have 2 distinctly different approaches to optimizing content for citation at the 2 different stages of a users AI decision making architecture.
7. We also know that *where* a brand might be mentioned is wildly different depending on the vertical, and that the overlap between mention and source of truth is dependant upon several reasons (SEMRush 2025): 

Criticality of Information: Sectors where accuracy and trust are paramount—such as finance and health—tend to have a higher overlap between what’s mentioned and what’s cited as a source because AIs err toward citing trusted, authoritative, and well-documented brands.

Community-Driven Sectors: Fields like fashion and technology often have wider conversation but less source overlap. Many brands are mentioned in reviews and discussions, but only a few are considered primary sources, reducing overlap.

Brand Diversity in Mentions versus Sources: In consumer electronics, a few brands dominate both mentions and sources, shrinking the divide. In B2B services, there’s more brand diversity in both mentions and sources, but still not much overlap: most cited sources aren’t the most mentioned, and vice versa.

. 
8. Because of this AI decision making architecture largely living within the AI platform user interface, we can infer that website owners may have to become comfortable with permanently less human traffic, and that they will need to treat autonomous traffic as first party, as these become the intermediaries through which users will first come into contact with their website and brand.
9. We expect as these platforms mature and functionality changes, approaches to optimizing for AI visibility may need to continuously adapt, and because each platform exhibits different characteristics, and the AI ecosystem is evolving so rapidly as this is a transition period between the web horizons (i.e. we are leaving horizon 1, we are entering horizon 2, and we don't know what horizon 3 will fully look like), this adaptation may need to occur in much shorter cycles than typically associated with traditional SEO approaches where Google's search algorithm exhibited remarkable stability with infrequent volatile changes. Organizations and agencies may need to bifurcate into specialist teams that concentrate on specific AI platform optimization, as well as specialist teams that concentrate specific industry verticals, working together with combined expertise.
