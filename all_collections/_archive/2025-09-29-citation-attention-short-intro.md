### TL;DR

* Users click AI citations at 1% vs 15% for traditional search—a 15:1 differential affecting 700 million weekly ChatGPT users
* Only 7% of sources appear across all AI platforms, while 71% appear on just one—platform-specific strategies now essential
* Two-stage user journey: Stage 1 prioritizes Reddit and forums for discovery; Stage 2 uses official sources for validation
* Practical Guidance (29%) and Writing (24%) dominate AI usage, with most interactions never leaving the platform
* Citation click-through rates improve from 1% to 3-5% with better design (Perplexity vs ChatGPT), suggesting optimization opportunities
* Adobe shows AI-referred visitors browse 12% more pages but convert 9% less—requiring new conversion strategies

## From Academic Theory to Business Reality

Let's acknowledge the elephant in the room. The previous version of this analysis was a 650-source academic meta-analysis that, while comprehensive, proved impenetrable for most digital professionals who need actionable insights today.

This version strips away the theoretical complexity to focus on what actually matters: how the shift from search to AI affects your website traffic, what you can do about it, and why traditional metrics might be lying to you.

The research is clear. The implications are profound. Your response needs to be immediate.

## The Great Disappearing Act of Web Traffic

Here's what's happening right now: 700 million people use ChatGPT weekly. When they ask questions, the AI provides answers with citations to sources. Users read the AI's response and move on. They don't click through.

The numbers tell the story:
- Traditional search: 15% click on any organic result
- Google's Position 1: 39.8% click-through rate
- AI platform citations: 1% click-through rate

Mail Online discovered this the hard way. Despite maintaining top search rankings and appearing in AI citations, their daily traffic dropped from 6,000 to 100 clicks—a 98% reduction (Mediaweek, 2025).

This pattern repeats across industries. Publishers report less than 1% of total website traffic comes from AI platform referrals. The "authority-traffic paradox" means your content gains credibility and influence without generating website visits.

## Platform Roulette: Why Your AI Visibility Depends on Which Platform Users Choose

Each AI platform plays favorites differently, and the overlap is minimal:

**ChatGPT** loves Reddit (appearing in 141% of prompts—yes, more than once per query) and Wikipedia (152%). The platform prioritizes community discussions and user-generated content over corporate websites.

**Gemini** sticks closest to traditional Google rankings with the lowest source diversity. If you rank well in Google Search, you have better odds here—but the citation click-through remains minimal.

**Perplexity** emphasizes research-backed content and academic sources. The platform shows citations more prominently, achieving 3-5% click-through rates—still low, but 3-5x better than ChatGPT.

**Claude** focuses on authoritative, comprehensive content with strong documentation. Professional users dominate here, creating different citation patterns than consumer-focused platforms.

Only 46 sources (7% of those studied) appear across all four platforms. These universal sources—Google, Wikipedia, YouTube—already dominate traditional search. For everyone else, 71% of sources appear on only ONE platform.

What this means: Your AI optimization strategy can't be platform-agnostic. You need to choose your battles.
