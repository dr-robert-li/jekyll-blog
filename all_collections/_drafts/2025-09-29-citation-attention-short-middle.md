## The Two-Stage Decision Process That Changes Everything

Forget everything you know about the customer journey. AI users follow a completely different path, and understanding it determines whether your content gets cited at all.

### Stage 1: Discovery Through Community Sentiment

When users ask "What's the best project management software for small teams?", AI platforms don't immediately cite official websites. Instead, they synthesize discussions from Reddit threads, Quora answers, and specialized forums.

User-generated content dominates this stage because AI models treat community consensus as a proxy for real-world validation. A product mentioned positively across multiple Reddit discussions carries more weight than any corporate claim.

This explains why officially published content is about half as effective at getting cited as user-generated content. Your polished product pages and carefully crafted blog posts lose to authentic user discussions.

### Stage 2: Validation Through Official Sources

Only after users narrow their choices do they seek specific information: "Does Notion have Gantt charts?" or "What does Asana cost for 10 users?"

Now AI platforms cite official websites, documentation, and pricing pages. But here's the catch—users might still never click through. The AI extracts and presents the information directly.

This two-stage architecture creates the "mention-source divide." Brands frequently discussed in communities (high mentions) might never appear as authoritative sources (low citations). Conversely, brands with comprehensive documentation might be cited without being recommended.

SEMRush's analysis reveals the divide varies by industry:
- **Finance**: 22-27 brands achieve both high mentions and citations (institutional authority matters)
- **Fashion**: Only 3 brands achieve both (community opinion dominates)
- **Business Services**: 12-22 brands achieve both (mixed signals)

## Why Users Don't Click (And When They Do)

The data from 700 million ChatGPT users reveals something crucial: only 24% of interactions involve "seeking information"—the behavior most like traditional search. The rest breaks down as:

- **Practical Guidance** (29%): "How do I..." questions where users want step-by-step instructions
- **Writing** (24%): Creating and editing content directly in the AI
- **Asking** (49% of all interactions): Seeking advice and recommendations
- **Doing** (40%): Task completion within the platform

Users rate "Asking" interactions highest for satisfaction. They prefer the AI's synthesized advice over clicking through to multiple sources. This behavior intensifies for non-critical information where validation seems unnecessary.

Adobe's research offers hope: citation click-through improved from October 2024 to February 2025 as platforms matured and users grew familiar with interfaces. But we're still talking about improvements from 1% to perhaps 2-3%—not a return to traditional search patterns.

The interface matters enormously. Perplexity's prominent citation numbering achieves 3-5% click-through. ChatGPT's subtle citation formatting stays around 1%. This 3-5x difference suggests optimization opportunities, but only if platforms maintain or improve citation visibility.

## What This Means for Your Business

### The Authority-Traffic Paradox in Practice

Your content can now gain massive authority without generating proportional traffic. This hits content-focused websites hardest—news publishers, blogs, educational resources—where the entire business model assumes traffic leads to revenue.

The paradox intensifies for non-critical content. Users won't validate restaurant recommendations, product reviews, or how-to guides. They will check official sources for pricing, specifications, or regulatory information.

### The Quality Visitor Contradiction

When users do click through from AI citations, they behave differently:
- Browse 12% more pages (6.2 vs 5.5 for search)
- Spend 41% longer on site
- Show 23% lower bounce rates
- Convert 9% less on average

These visitors arrive pre-qualified, having already consumed comprehensive information. They need validation, not education. Traditional conversion optimization—simplified forms, clear CTAs, faster pages—might actually work against you.

Travel sites see the exception: AI-referred visitors generate 80% more revenue per visit. Financial services show 18% higher conversion rates. But fashion and retail see continued struggles with lower conversion despite higher engagement.

### Platform Concentration Creates New Gatekeepers

With 71% of sources appearing on only one platform, your visibility depends entirely on which platforms your audience uses. A dominant position on ChatGPT means nothing if your customers prefer Gemini.

This concentration varies by platform:
- **ChatGPT**: Most democratic distribution but lowest click-through
- **Gemini**: Highest concentration, favors existing Google winners
- **Perplexity**: Moderate concentration with better click-through
- **Claude**: Professional focus with different citation patterns

You can't optimize for all platforms equally. The cost would be prohibitive and the strategies often conflict.
